The streets were still dozing, stuck with a light haze, and the first passers -by hurried in their business. Somewhere in the yard, the old cat lazily stretched, enjoying the warmth after a long cold winter.\n\nThere was a small coffee kiosk at the corner of the central square. The smell of freshly ground coffee was mixed with baking aroma, creating a special atmosphere of morning comfort. The barista, smiling, prepared an espresso for regular visitors who came here in the morning before starting the day.\n\nA young girl with a book in her hands sat near the fountain. She lifted her eyes from time to time, as if looking into the distance, and again plunged into the text. Her light scarf was barely noticeable in the wind. Pigeons were fussed nearby, hoping for a generous hand of one of the passers -by."
